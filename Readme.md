# Wordpress Docker Scaffold

I initiate this scaffold because when I dev a wordpress I don't want to install any tech stack directly on my local machine.

## Getting started

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Please edit that file as your configuration purpose.

## For Existing Project

Place your `wp-content` into `/app/` folder.
